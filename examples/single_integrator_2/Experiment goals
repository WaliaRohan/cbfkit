1. Figure out how to randomize each experiment
2. Collect data for multiple runs - 100. Note how much time that takes
3. Print number of violations, max violation value
4. In your results, report:
	1. Type of CBF
	2. Type of CLF
	3. Start/goal
	4. safety violation time steps/total number of time steps
	5. Max safety violations
	6. Simulation time step
	7. Simulation time

Questions for Mitchell:

1. Should we only randomize noise for the 1000 runs?
2. Should I collect runs from different starting points?
3. Should I collect
